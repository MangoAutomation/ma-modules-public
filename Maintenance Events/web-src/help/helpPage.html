<p>
    Maintenance events are used to schedule maintenance periods for data sources, such that 
    events raised by the data source or its points during the period are "suppressed", meaning 
    that the events' event handlers are not run and it is automatically acknowledged. When the 
    maintenance event becomes active, a single event is raised. This event is deactived when the 
    event returns to normal or is manually disabled. Note that maintenance events can also be 
    manually activated and deactived as necessary.
</p>

<h2>Maintenance events list</h2>

<p>
    To add a new maintenance event, click the <b>Add Maintenance Events</b>. To edit an existing maintenance event, click the 
    event's description in the "Maintenance events" list.
</p>

<h2>Editing maintenance event details</h2>

<p>
    The <b>XID</b> is a unique identifier for the event, which is used in the import/export function. 
    It can have any value that is unique among maintenance events up to 50 characters long. It is 
    defaulted to a value that is - at the time of generation - already unique.
</p>

<p>
    The <b>Data source</b> is the data source to which the maintenance event applies.
</p>

<p>
    The <b>Alias</b> is an optional value that will be used as the description for the event throughout the system if it is 
    provided. Otherwise, the automatically generated description will be used.
</p>

<p>
    The <b>Alarm level</b> determines whether the maintenance event raises an alarm when active, and if so the severity of the alarm.
    See the general help page for information on Alarms.
</p>

<p>
    The <b>Schedule type</b> determines the basis period of the event. These types include hourly, 
    daily, etc. For example, a schedule type of hourly will run once every hour. If a schedule that 
    runs, say, twice a day is needed, it is necessary to define two daily scheduled events, one for 
    each time. It is however possible to define a cron pattern that runs multiple times within a period. 
    (See the "cron pattern" documentation for more information.)
</p>

<p>
    A maintenance event can be <b>Disabled</b> so that it does not run. This can be useful if you do 
    not wish to delete the event, but also do not currently want it enabled.
</p>

<h2>Active/Inactive times</h2>

<p>
    The fields available for editing active and inactive times depend upon the schedule type chosen. 
    Most fields should require no explanation beyond that they are exclusively based upon the Gregorian 
    calendar. For more information on cron patterns, see the "Cron pattern" documentation.
</p>

<p>
    Active/inactive times can straddle the given time period. For example, an hourly schedule can 
    become active at 55:00 and inactive at 05:00 (thus active for 10 minutes). Note that it is possible, 
    though not very useful, to define cron patterns that do not neatly activate and inactivate (i.e. they may 
    activate multiple times before inactivating and vice versa).
</p>

<h2>Manual control</h2>

<p>
    To manually enable or disable a maintenance event, click the <b>Toggle Event</b> switch at the top right.
