<p>
  This data source reads a file as an ASCII character stream on a line by line basis.
</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
  Every data source requires a <b>Name</b>, which can be any description, and an <b>XID</b>, which must be unique among
  all data sources. The <b>Update period</b> specifies how frequently the data source checks the file. The <b>File Path</b>
  points to the file you want to access information from. The file path is absolute, but networked paths are not supported.
  File paths can be restricted in the ASCII File section of the system settings. Use the "Check" button to verify your file 
  path references an existing file.
