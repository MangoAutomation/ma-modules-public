<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The ASCII file reader system settings provide the user the chance to restrict access for this data source to
certain areas of the filesystem. By default, the ASCII file reader is not permitted to read inside the Mango/ directory.
Path restrictions are semicolon delimited (i.e. /path/to/restricted-directory-or-file-1;/path/to/restricted-directoy-2 ) and
should be canonical, absolute paths. Relative paths will most likely be considered as within the Mango folder, but they will
be converted into canonical paths when they are saved.</p>
