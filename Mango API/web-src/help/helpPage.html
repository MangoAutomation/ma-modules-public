<h2>CORS Support</h2>
<p>
    The API is designed to work with Cross Origin Sharing but the filter must be enabled first.
     To enable the filter you must edit the <b>rest.cors.*</b> section in the <b>env.properties</b> file and 
     restart Mango. Note that changes to this file are only picked up upon a restart of Mango.
