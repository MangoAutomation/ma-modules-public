<h2>Swagger UI</h2>
<p>
	Mango's REST uses Swagger to allow code auto-generation and includes an API exploration tool at /swagger-ui.html.  
	Note that this is disabled by default.  To enable this feature set the env property swagger.enabled=true.  
	The Swagger JSON api definition can be accessed at: /swagger/v2/api-docs Note that the versions of the REST api 
	are separated and accessed by the drop down in the top right corner of the UI.
</p>
<p>	
	It is possible to expose Swagger for public view to non logged in Users by setting swagger.apidocs.protected=false.
	The REST api is still restricted but this allows users to explore the endpoints and test them via supplying a token.  
</p>
<p>
	To use a token, first generate one in Mango and then click the 'Authorize' button in the Swagger UI.  In the 'value' field enter 
	the text below.  Ensure you put a space between the word Bearer and the token value.
</p>
<pre>Bearer token-value</pre>

<h2>CORS Support</h2>
<p>
    The API is designed to work with Cross Origin Sharing but the filter must be enabled first.
     To enable the filter you must edit the <b>rest.cors.*</b> section in the <b>env.properties</b> file and 
     restart Mango. Note that changes to this file are only picked up upon a restart of Mango.
