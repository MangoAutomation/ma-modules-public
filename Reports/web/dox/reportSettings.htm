  Use the "purge report instances" settings to set the maximum age of a report instance before it is purged from the 
  database. Purging permanently deletes the report instance. It is best to set this value as low as possible since 
  reports can potentially consume a great deal of available storage space. Purging can be prevented by setting the 
  "prevent purge" attribute on the report instance.

Use the "Report work item priority" setting to set the priority of the report instances when they are run.  High will run at the same priority
 as the data source polls and will begin almost instantaneously.  Medium will run at the same level as the event handlers.  Low will run in the background. 
 The High and Low priorities allow for multiple reports to run at the same time.  Low priority will run reports in the order they are scheduled one by one.
