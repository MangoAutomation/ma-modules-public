Property Rights in the Licensed Product and Documentation. Your only rights in 
the Licensed Product and Documentation are the rights expressly granted in 
this Agreement; all other rights are reserved by Radix. Radix's licensors are 
third-party beneficiaries of, and thus may enforce against you, the license 
restrictions and confidentiality obligations in this Agreement with respect to 
their intellectual property and proprietary information. Radix may freely use 
and disseminate any Feedback you provide. You agree not to claim that Radix 
owes you any compensation for its use or dissemination of such Feedback.
5.2. Limitation of Liability. For each Licensed Product you license or 
purchase from Radix under this Agreement, Radix's maximum total, cumulative 
liability to you is limited to One Hundred and no/100 United States Dollars 
(US$100) (regardless of the nature of the liability or the nature or number of 
claims giving rise to the liability). Radix will not, under any circumstances 
or any theory of liability, be liable to you or any third party for any lost 
profits, loss of data, loss of privacy or consequential, incidental, or 
special damages arising from this Agreement or the products and services 
provided to you under this Agreement, even if Radix has been advised of the 
possibility off such damages. The limitations of liability in this section are 
a fundamental part of this Agreement and are intended to apply even if an 
exclusive remedy is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
5.3 Indemnification. You will indemnify, hold harmless, and, at Radix’s 
option, defend Radix from and against any losses, damages, liabilities, and 
costs resulting from any third-party claim, suit, action, or proceeding based 
on your: (i) negligence or willful misconduct; (ii) use of the Licensed 
Product or Documentation in a manner not authorized or contemplated by this 
Agreement; or (iii) use of the Licensed Product in combination with data, 
software, hardware, equipment or technology not provided by Radix or 
authorized by Radix in writing; provided that you may not settle any such 
matter against Radix unless such settlement completely and forever releases 
Radix from all liability with respect to such matter or unless Radix consents 
to such settlement, and further provided that Radix will have the
right, at its option, to defend itself against any such matter or to 
participate in the defense thereof by counsel of its own choice.
5.4. Export Controls. You acknowledge that the Licensed Product, including 
technical data, is subject to U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. 
Export Administration Act and its associated regulations, and may be subject 
to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree to comply with 
all applicable U.S. and international laws governing export and re-export of 
the Licensed Product, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, as 
well as end-user, end-use and destination restrictions issued by the United 
States and other governments.
5.5. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement is governed by the laws of 
the United States and the State of Texas, without regard to conflicts of laws 
principles. The federal and state courts located in Dallas County, Texas have 
exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising from or relating to this 
Agreement, and each party consents to such jurisdiction and venue.
5.6. Notices. Any notice, approval, consent, or other communication intended 
to have legal effect under this Agreement must be given to the other party in 
writing, must be sent by first-class, registered, or overnight mail or private 
overnight courier (to the address for the other party stated on the signature 
page, unless the other party has given notice of a new address), and will be 
deemed given upon receipt or when delivery is refused.
5.7. Waivers. Either party's failure to enforce any provision of this 
Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of the future enforcement of that 
provision or enforcement of any other provision. In order to be binding, a 
waiver must be in writing and signed by the party giving the waiver.
5.8. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent 
contractors. Neither party is the agent or partner of the other party, or has 
any power or authority to act on behalf of the other party.
5.9. Severability. If any provision in this Agreement is found to be invalid 
or unenforceable as written, the remaining provisions will remain in full 
force and effect and the invalid or unenforceable provision is to be construed 
(and, if necessary, modified) so that it is valid and enforceable to the 
greatest extent possible.
5.10. Attorneys' Fees. The prevailing party in any action to enforce this 
Agreement will be entitled to recover costs and expenses including reasonable 
attorneys' fees.
5.11. Remedies. Except where this Agreement expressly provides exclusive 
remedies, all rights and remedies of either party (including termination 
rights) are cumulative. You agree that monetary damages alone would not be an 
adequate remedy, and therefore Radix will be entitled to injunctive relief if 
you materially breach the license restrictions or confidentiality provisions 
in this Agreement.
5.12. Force Majeure. Each party will be excused from performance of its 
obligations under this Agreement, except payment obligations, to the extent 
that performance is rendered impossible by earthquake, fire, flood, 
governmental action, labor disruptions, supplier failures, or any other event 
or circumstance beyond that party's reasonable control.
5.13. Construction. Section headings in this Agreement are for convenience 
only. The word "including" (and variations thereof) is not intended to be 
limiting. No rule of strict construction is to be used when interpreting this 
Agreement.
5.14. Government Users. If you are a branch or agency of the United States 
Government, or are acquiring the Licensed Product on behalf of any branch or 
agency of the United States Government, then the following provision applies. 
The Licensed Product and Documentation are comprised of "commercial computer 
software" and "commercial computer software documentation", as such terms are 
used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212, and are provided to the Government (i) for 
acquisition by or on behalf of civilian agencies, consistent with the policy 
set forth in 48 C.F.R. 12.212; or (ii) for acquisition by or on behalf of 
units of the Department of Defense, consistent with the policies set forth in 
48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 and 227.7202-3.
5.15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement 
between the parties concerning its subject matter, and supersedes any prior or 
contemporaneous agreements, communications, or understandings (whether written

5.16. Amendments. This Agreement may be amended only by means of a written 
instrument signed by authorized representatives of both parties that 
specifically refers to this Agreement and states the parties' intention to 
amend it.
