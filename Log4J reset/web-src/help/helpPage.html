<h2></h2>
<p>
    The Log4J Reset utility lets administrators reload the log4j2.xml configuration file during runtime.  The general use case is to modify the file to collect 
    debugging information and then reset the file to its original state to reduce log accumulation.
</p>

<h2>Log4J Configuration</h2>
<p>
    The log4j2.xml configuration file is located in MA_HOME/classes/log4j2.xml, this file is automatically loaded at startup.  However it is recommended to make changes 
    to a copy of the file place at MA_HOME/overrides/classes/log4j2.xml.  
    <br>
    NOTE: If you are using any of the logging startup extension in the bin folder the file that will be reloaded is the file defined in the extension.
</p>
<p>
