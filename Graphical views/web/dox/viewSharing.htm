<p>
  Views may be shared with other users in a way similar to how they are shared with anonymous users. Shared views are 
  not editable by the user with whom you are sharing (although the user does have the right to removed themselves from
  the share list). To share a view that you have created, select the user from the drop down box and click the
  <img src="images/add.png"/> icon. Then, choose the access type that the user should have, either "read" (not allowed
  to set points) or "set" (allowed to set points). Add as many shares to the view as required. To save, click the "Save"
  button. To delete a user from the share list, click the <img src="images/bullet_delete.png"/> icon associated with 
  the user's row.
