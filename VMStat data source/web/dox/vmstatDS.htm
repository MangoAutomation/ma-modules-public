<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  The VMStat data source is used to monitor various performance aspects of a *nix host. When the data source starts a
  process is initiated that runs the vmstat program, and the output from that process is monitored.
</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
  Every data source requires a <b>Name</b>, which can be any description. The <b>Poll seconds</b> setting determines 
  how often the vmstat process will report data back to Mango. The <b>Output scale</b> can be set to automatically 
  adjust byte values to different scales, including bytes, k, KB, m, and MB.
